# Overview

Taskana manages human tasks. This includes defining the tasks, distributing them to the corresponding workers and keeping track of the task execution. Taskana also offers options for customizing each task with attachments, object references etc.. In the following article, the basic entities of Taskana and operations on them are explained.

## Taskana Entities
All Taskana Entities can be found in the Java API (link). For better readability, they are capitalized in the documentation. 

Taskana operates using Tasks, Classifications and Workbaskets. The entities are stored in the configured database (link). 

Note: !! make Note beautiful in Markdown !! Besides Tasks, Classifications and Workbaskets, there are also interfaces for summary objects: TaskSummaries, ClassificationSummaries and WorkbasketSummaries. Each summary object refers to a full entity, but only contains the most important imformation. For example, a TaskSummary with id 1234 refers to the Task with the id 1234. However, the TaskSummary does not contain the Attachment of the Task as well as some other information.

### Task

The Task interface can be found in (path to Task). It represents a human task that should be perfomed by one of the relevant users. A Task is identified by unique id. Each Task has exactly one Classification. This Classification determines some properties of the Task. For example, you can prioritize Tasks differently by using different Classifications. The Task is assigned to exactly one Workbasket so that different users have access to different Tasks. In order to enable the Task lifecycle, the Task has a state. It's READY after the Task creation, and COMPLETED after the Task completion. See here (link) to read more about the properties, the Task lifecycle as well as provided functionality.

## Operations on Entities
You can create, update and delete entities. These operations on entities can be found in the corresponding Services: TaskService, CLassificationService and WorkbasketService. You can also make queries with filtering and sorting by properties.  

### How to create a Task (works for Workbasket and Classification too): 
1. First create a Task object that is not in the database yet with method 
    ```TaskService.newTask()```
2. Then set some properties of that Task via its setter methods.
3. Finally persist this Task to the database via ```TaskSerivce.createTask()```

### How to manipulate a Task?


Not all properties of a task can be set via the API. You must rather use the Action methods of TaskService to manipulate these properties.
For example, a task is created via TaskService.newTask(). In this call, you have to specify in which workbasket the task is to be created. This can either be done by specifying the Id of the workbasket or key and domain of the workbasket (note: a workbasket key is a human readable key that identifies a workbasket inside a specific domain. WorkbasketKey is not unique by itself, but only in combination with the domain).
Once a task object is created, its associated workbasket can only be changed by method TaskSerivce.transfer().
In addition, once a task is created, it is in the state READY. The state of a task can only be modified by TaskService methods claim, forceClaim, cancelClaim, forceCancelClaim, completeTask, forceCompleteTask, and deleteTask.
In addition, once an action method modfies a task, several timestamps on the task, like claimed, completed, modfied, etc. are changed.
Corresponding considerations apply to Workbasket and Classification objects.
How to use Taskanaâ€™s java API in an application?

 

When you intend to use taskana in your application, you have to follow the following steps:

    get a DataSource that addresses taskana's database.

    Create a pro.taskana.configuration.TaskanaEngineConfiguration passing in that DataSource.

    Call TaskanaEngineConfiguration.buildEngine to obtain a TaskanaEngine.

    Use TaskanaEngine's method getClassificationService, getTaskService and getWorkbasketService in order to obtain the various service objects that are required to create, delete and manipulate tasks, workbaskets and classifications.
